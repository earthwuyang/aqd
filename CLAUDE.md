you should first read the files in ~/DB/aqd_pg_duckdb, in that directory AQD is implemented on postgres_scanner extension for duckdb, howebver, in this directory called pg_duckdb_postgres, you are supposed to implement AQD paper (~/DB/aqd_pg_duckdb/main.tex) in a docker container running modified postgres with extension pg_duckdb, you should modify postgres kernel to implement cost-threshold routing and machine learning model-baseed routing, you should modify postgres source code, the entire working pipeline can be similar to the ~/DB/aqd_pg_duckdb, please implement this and finally summarize your steps in README.md and report the offline ML model prediction accuracy  and online batch query dispatching makespan and latency in the README.md. for long running queries like data collection, you should use tmux to run script and check the progress from time to time, let's go!
